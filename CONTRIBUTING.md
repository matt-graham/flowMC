### Expectations

flowMC is developed and maintained in my spare time and, while I try to be responsive, I don't always get to every issue immediately.
If it has been more than a week or two, feel free to ping me to try to get my attention.
This is subject to changes as the community grows

### Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/kazewong/flowMC/issues). If you're unable to find an
open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
one](https://github.com/kazewong/flowMC/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title
and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and the
simplest possible **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is
not occurring. Also label the issue with the bug label.
